TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT eth0.rgmii0/no10support.clkmux25o/V7.U0_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

A max delay constraint with -datapath_only has been applied between rst0/async.rstoutl_reg/C and eth0.rgmii0/txd_reg[3]/CLR. The startpoint(s) and endpoint(s) either belong to the same clock domain or belong to two clock domains that can safely be timed together (without valid synchronizer). It is only recommended to use the -datapath_only option on paths between clocks that do not have a known phase relationship. This DRC is waived when a synchronizer is found on the path endpoint

Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '7' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
