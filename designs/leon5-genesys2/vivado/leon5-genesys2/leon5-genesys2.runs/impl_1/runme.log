WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.

If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP l5sys/cpuloop[0].nocgcpu.core/mul0/xm3232.m3232/pipe2.arch0.dwm/__0 multiplier stage l5sys/cpuloop[0].nocgcpu.core/mul0/xm3232.m3232/pipe2.arch0.dwm/__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net eth0.rgmii0/no10support.clkmux25o/clk10_100o is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin eth0.rgmii0/no10support.clkmux25o/V7.U0_i_1/O, cell eth0.rgmii0/no10support.clkmux25o/V7.U0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal mig_gen.gen_mig.ddrc/MCB_inst/u_mig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the mig_gen.gen_mig.ddrc/MCB_inst/u_mig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of mig_gen.gen_mig.ddrc/MCB_inst/u_mig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
